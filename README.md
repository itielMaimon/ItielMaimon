### Hi there 👋
I'm Itiel, I'm a Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience developing mobile (Android, Flutter, React Native) and full stack web (React, Node.js, MongoDB) apps.
I love learning new things, and passionate about the art of writing clean, elegant, beautiful code, that just makes software development so fun.
- 🔭 I’m currently working with Unity 3D.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in React and Node.js.
